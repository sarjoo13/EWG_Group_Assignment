# EWG_Group_Assignment

This repository consists of two models: The standard TSP and the time-dependent TSP (TD-TSP).

The latter is currently unfinished as the model reports for the first test route 
(actually the second in our set of set of top-20-drivers-routes) infeasibility. 

The TSP model on the contrary reports some first results. 
The folder contains the following files
- TSP_Data.py which prepares the data from our data sets to fit the model setup
- TSP_Model.py contains the model. This is the file that should be run in order to obtain our results.
- sh_routes_top_20_most_traveled_drivers.csv and sh_undirected_graph_tod.csv contain the data necessary for our model.
- prelim_results.txt reports some lists obtained during our tests
