Model.py consists of the model that is implemented for a toy-instance defined there. 
Unfortunately, the toy model seems to be infeasible just now. 
I'll have to check whether it is due to the instance, the model or the implementation. 

Data.py is intended for data reading and preprocessing. 
However, building the matrix of matrix of interest, needs far too much time. 
Is there a faster way? 

To do: 
- Fix the model
- Fix the data preparation
- Apply the model to the actual data
